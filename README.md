# Slingshot
Slingshot is a Python library for crating reproducible modular petitions for Brazilian law-suits.

## Objective
Bringing to the community of law and technology students a open-source quality tool for creating procedural documents without having to lay on expensive and proprietary solutions bringed on for law suits.

## Why use Slingshot.
Slingshot creates procedural documents by chaining content blocks (Layers) in a way that is very alike to Keras high level Deep Learning framework, and let law-academic learn programming in a useful, rich and difunded language, Python. 

Also, not only it is very easy to learn (as Python itseld), but part the knowledge adquired on learning how to use it can be leveraged to use in other coding tasks, as Data Science activities, web-crawling and even web-development.

## Knowledge requirements
 * Python syntax
 * String manipulations
 * Python OOP basics (we already did the hard part for you)
 
 ## System requirements
  * Python >= 3.7
  * python-markdown
  * pandoc
  * pdfkit
  
 ## Slingshot basics
 Slingshot documents are built by chaineble-content blocks, **Layer** class objects that are wrapped by **Document** class objects. Once all the content blocks are added and chained to the **Document**, it has built-in methods that generates and formats it in both **pdf**, **docx** and **html** format.
